Que: Create a playbook called packages.yml that:

- Installs the php and mariadb packages on hosts in the dev, test, and prod host groups
- Installs the RPM Development Tools package group on hosts in the dev host group
- Updates all packages to the latest version on hosts in the dev host group

- name: Package management
  hosts: all
  vars:
   pkgs:
    - php
    - mariadb
  tasks:
   - name: Install the php and mariadb package
     ansible.builtin.package:
      name: "{{ item }}"
      state: present
     loop: "{{ pkgs }}"
     when: inventory_hostname in groups['dev'] or inventory_hostname in groups['test'] or inventory_hostname in groups['prod']
   - name: Install the RPM Development Tools package
     ansible.builtin.package:
      name: "@RPM Development tools"
      state: present
     when: inventory_hostname in groups['dev']

   - name: Update all package
     ansible.builtin.package:
      name: "*"
      state: latest
     when: inventory_hostname in groups['dev']

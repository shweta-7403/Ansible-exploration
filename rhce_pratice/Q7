Que: Create a playbook called balance.yml as follows:

The playbook contains a play that runs on hosts in the balancers host group and uses the balancer
role.
  - This role configures a service to load balance web server requests between hosts in the webservers
     host group.
  - When implemented, browsing to hosts in the balancers host group (for example
     http://node5.example.com ) should produce the following output:

Welcome to node3.example.com on 192.168.10.z
  - Reloading the browser should return output from the alternate web server:

Welcome to node4.example.com on 192.168.10.a
 * The playbook contains a play that runs on hosts in the webservers host group and uses the
phpinfo role.
When implemented, browsing to hosts in the webservers host group with the URL /hello.php
should produce the following output:

Hello PHP World from FQDN

where FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the host.

For example, browsing to http://node3.example.com/hello.php, should produce the following
output:
  Hello PHP World from node3.example.com
along with various details of the PHP configuration including the version of PHP that is installed.

* Similarly, browsing to http://node4.example.com/hello.php, should produce the following output:
   Hello PHP World from node4.example.com
along with various details of the PHP configuration including the version of PHP that is installed.
